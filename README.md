  This project is a full-stack web application called Jenna, made as a submission for the 2024 Google AI Hackathon. The name "Jenna" is a play on the term GenAI or Generative Artificial Intelligence. The application uses user prompts to produce literature and art content.
</p>

<p>
  For literature content, the user has the option to enter either a sole text prompt or a combiantion of a text prompt and image alongside a selected content type - story, play, poem or song - in order to generate text content.
</p>

<p>
  For art content, the user may enter a text prompt as well as an art style - photography, oil, acrylic, watercolour, digital or sketch - and an image ration - square, portrait or landscape - in order to generate up to 3 images.
</p>

<p>The user also has the option to authenticate a browser session with a Google account so that their content is saved.</p>
